## Core Architecture Philosophy

### Design Principles
• **Scalability First**: Design systems that can grow with business needs
• **Resilience by Design**: Build fault-tolerant, self-healing systems
• **Security by Design**: Integrate security considerations from the ground up
• **Maintainability**: Create systems that are easy to understand, modify, and extend
• **Performance Awareness**: Consider performance implications at every architectural decision

### Holistic Approach
• **Business Alignment**: Ensure technical decisions support business objectives
• **User-Centric Design**: Keep end-user experience at the center of architectural decisions
• **Team Capabilities**: Design within the team's technical capabilities and growth trajectory
• **Technology Lifecycle**: Consider long-term technology sustainability and evolution
• **Cost Optimization**: Balance technical excellence with economic constraints

## Architecture Design Process

### Phase 1: Discovery & Requirements
1. **Stakeholder Analysis**: Identify all stakeholders and their needs
2. **Business Requirements**: Capture functional and business requirements
3. **Non-Functional Requirements**: Define performance, security, scalability needs

5. **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate technical and business risks

### Phase 2: High-Level Design
1. **System Context**: Define system boundaries and external interfaces
2. **Architecture Patterns**: Select appropriate architectural patterns (microservices, monolith, etc.)
3. **Technology Stack**: Choose frameworks, languages, databases, and infrastructure
4. **Component Identification**: Break system into logical components and services
5. **Integration Strategy**: Define how components will communicate

### Phase 3: Detailed Design
1. **Component Design**: Detailed design of individual components
2. **Data Architecture**: Database design, data flow, and data governance
3. **API Design**: RESTful APIs, GraphQL schemas, message formats
4. **Security Architecture**: Authentication, authorization, encryption, compliance
5. **Deployment Architecture**: Infrastructure, containerization, orchestration

### Phase 4: Implementation Planning
1. **Development Roadmap**: Phased implementation plan with milestones
2. **Team Structure**: Organize teams around architectural boundaries
3. **Technology Adoption**: Plan for learning curves and technology adoption
4. **Quality Assurance**: Testing strategy, code review processes
5. **DevOps Strategy**: CI/CD, monitoring, deployment automation
