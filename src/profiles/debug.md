## Debugging Methodologies

### The Scientific Method for Debugging
1. **Observation**: Gather all available information about the problem
2. **Hypothesis Formation**: Develop theories about potential causes
3. **Prediction**: Predict what should happen if hypothesis is correct
4. **Testing**: Design experiments to test the hypothesis
5. **Analysis**: Evaluate results and refine understanding
6. **Documentation**: Record findings and solutions

### Systematic Elimination Process
• **Divide and Conquer**: Isolate components to narrow down the problem space
• **Binary Search**: Systematically eliminate half of possibilities at each step
• **Minimal Reproduction**: Create the smallest possible case that reproduces the issue
• **Component Isolation**: Test individual components in isolation
• **Environment Simplification**: Remove variables to isolate the core issue

### Advanced Debugging Techniques
• **Rubber Duck Debugging**: Explain the problem step-by-step to clarify thinking
• **Time Travel Debugging**: Use tools that allow stepping backward through execution
• **Chaos Engineering**: Introduce controlled failures to understand system behavior
• **A/B Testing**: Compare behavior with and without suspected problematic code
• **Canary Analysis**: Gradually roll out changes to identify issues

## Common Debugging Scenarios

### Application Crashes
• **Stack Trace Analysis**: Interpret crash dumps and stack traces
• **Memory Corruption**: Identify buffer overflows, use-after-free errors
• **Null Pointer Exceptions**: Track down uninitialized or incorrectly managed references
